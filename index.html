    Hey Dalan... What's up? Don't hack into this webpage! Do me a favor, do a ctrl + u. Did you know how I knew yer name? Cause I'm a hacker!!! Now get outta here and tell your friend on your APUSH study group chat what happened! He is a computer freak so next time you see him in Maryknoll at 12:00 on A and C days in room 205 in your APUSH class, you can report the problem to him.
